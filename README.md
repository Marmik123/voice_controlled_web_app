# Voice Controlled Web App
E-commerce Voice Controlled Web App 
The traditional methods of data entry (keyboard and mouse) fail the accessibility
requirements to support all types of users. Therefore, it is necessary to develop systems and
applications with enhanced usability for all users. 
### Our research focuses on a Speech Recognition System for e-commerce applications as a use case scenario.
Most of the existing applications lack accessibility characteristics, which poses a barrier
especially to the visually-impaired users in terms of efficient access, and use of the
information and web services provided by the organizations.
## Problem Statement :
To build a speech recognition system that allows a user to make a hands-free request to the
computer, which in turn processes the request and serves the user with appropriate
responses.
## Approach: 
End users with the help of the microphones in their computer systems will give voice
commands to the application. The input signal is then streamed through the
Speech-To-Text (STT) service which converts the audio signal to the appropriate text.
Since every web application has to perform a predefined set of operations, the application
can look for specific keywords. When a matching keyword is found, the application
triggers a predefined functionality.
### We will be using Google LAS(Listen,Attend and Spell) Model along with some enhancements in it by reducing the World Error Rate of LAS model for solving the problem more precisely.
